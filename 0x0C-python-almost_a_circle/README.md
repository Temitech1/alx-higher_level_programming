Authored by Opeyemi Alabi.

This repository contains the solutions for the "0x0C-python-almost_a_circle" projects, which are part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Description

The "0x0C-python-almost_a_circle" projects cover various concepts in Python, including object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, unit testing, file I/O, and more. The projects are designed to build a foundation in Python programming and reinforce core concepts.

The projects are divided into multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python programming. The tasks include creating base models, implementing classes and inheritance, writing unit tests, handling JSON serialization and deserialization, and more.

## Repository Contents

- `models/`: Contains the Python module files for the project, including the base models and their implementations.
- `tests/`: Contains the unit tests for the project, covering various functionalities and edge cases.
- `main/`: Contains sample main files to demonstrate the usage of the classes and functions implemented in the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Project Requirements

- Python 3.4 or later
- PEP 8 style guidelines are followed for code consistency and readability.
